> **1971** broadcasts live recorded devil-may-care four decks mixes aiming at spatiotemporal perceptive distortion: **Paolo** plays drones and tones and a million human voices and the planet Earth on top, so slow a wreck your heart will break.<br><br>the show is recorded live and broadcast later when the time is ripe with juices and fluids and ready for mauling. the transmission is collaged with the broadcaster edits and mashups of other people sounds and fragments and shreds of private recordings and compositions from the deepest recesses of his personal archive. tracklists are thereby to be considered partial and as a measure of the sequence of entry of the tracks into the mix.
