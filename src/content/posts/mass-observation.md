> The Archive is a result of the work of Mass Observation. This social research organisation was founded in 1937 and aimed to create an ‘anthropology of ourselves’. The team recruited a team of investigators and a panel of volunteer writers to study the everyday lives of ordinary people in Britain. This original work continued until the early 1950s.

> we are interested to hear how writers experience their hands in day-to-day life. We would like to know how people use them and their feelings about this, but also their relationship with the hands of others.

Kinda glorious and fascinating and boring, all in one.
