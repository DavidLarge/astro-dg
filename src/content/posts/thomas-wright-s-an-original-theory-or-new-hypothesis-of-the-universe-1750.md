> Not all his ideas were as well-founded as his work on the *Via Lactea*; in a manuscript sequel to *An Original Theory*, he proposed “that the sky was solid and studied with inward-pointing volcanoes down whose shafts we see the stars”.

> Plate XXVII depicts a globe within a globe, part of his hypothesis on the patterns and rules followed by bodies in space. It’s a hypothesis which culminates in his globular visions of the last two plates, which show full and section views of “the Object of that incomprehensible Being, which alone and in himself comprehends and constitutes supreme Perfection”.
