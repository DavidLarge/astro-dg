> When astronauts showed signs of emotional burnout, they were assigned Silence No. 9: 37 minutes with no stimuli. No tasks. No contact. Not even movement. Just breathing. Just the internal noise.

The full description —&nbsp;<a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DL5fuqvxyvA/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">floating around the vertical-video space</a> —&nbsp;has the cadence of an LLM's output, and a suitably pat, neat little semantic bow to wrap it up.

The concept at large is wish fulfilment, most likely: the desire that if everything gets too much, one could just stop for an arbitrary time. The specificity (prime) number of minutes feels a little too much.
